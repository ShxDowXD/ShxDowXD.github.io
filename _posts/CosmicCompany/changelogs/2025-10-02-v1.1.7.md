## Additions
- New Windows on the ship!
  > [You can see into space or the moon you're landed on - you start with a roof and side window but more are purchasable from the shop]
- The ability to climb fast on ladders
  > [Will use some stamina]

## Fixes
- Stamina bar has been changed to be accurate
  > [It used to run out way too early]
- Multiple weathers not giving multipliers has been fixed
  > [Note: when there is a ">" signal instead of a "+" if 2 weathers are displayed, it means there is a 50/50 chance for each weather to be selected, and have it's multipliers applied].

## Changes
  - Loading screen messages have been changed to be more lore-friendly
