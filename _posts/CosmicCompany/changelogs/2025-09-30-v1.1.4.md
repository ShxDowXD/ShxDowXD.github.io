# Cosmic Company Modpack - v1.1.4
These patch notes can also be viewed in-game via the "Changelog" button on the main menu [If using the custom theme]
 
## Fixes 
- Fixed all players' health not reducing after entering the "critical injury" state - causing everyone to become permanently invincible
- **POTENTIALLY** Fixed the ever-lasting loading planet softlock bug - It was assumed to be "The Dam" interior.
## Removals 
- **Removed the Cursed Scraps mod**
>     [Causing the invincibility bug]
- **Removed "The Dam" interior**
>     [Possibly causing the loading softlock bug]
- **Removed Enemy and Scrap spawn rate scaling**
>    [Caused the Barber enemy to spawn every day, and caused interior generation to be different for each player - de-syncing their games]

## Additions 
- **Cause of death messages on day overview screen**
- **Added "LobbyControl" mod - fixes some lobby issues and allows players to join when the ship is in orbit, even after the game has been started.**
>     [Also adds options to switch the save file quickly while in game, toggle autosave and more]
- **Added a revamped EXP System**
>     [Displaying info and stats about each player on the day overview screen - as well as lots of extra ranks past "Leader"]
- **Re-added Dynamic Interior Variety**
>     [The longer you go without finding an interior, the more common it gets.]
- **More cosmetics**
 
##  **Custom Menu theme for the modpack!**
>    [You can disable it if you don't like it by disabling the "Emblem" mod in your modlist]
- View the changelog in game
- Custom blue Cosmic Company theme
